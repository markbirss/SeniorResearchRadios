This library meshed Raspberry Pi's with various sensors which combine to allow individual nodes to alert drivers of a crash.

## Required Repos and Libraries
The packaging of this repo right now is uncertain. These are the libraries used in making this project run. Thanks @wirekraken and Adafruit!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wirekraken/Raspberry-Pi-NRF24.git
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-gps
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-lsm303-accel
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-lsm303dlh-mag
```

## Usage

A wiring diagram will be uploaded along with instructions as to how to set up your hardware to make this run.
